Instructions
------------

These instructions will assume that you will use Anaconda. 
For experienced users with other setups, 
please install the environment found in `binder/environment.yml <https://github.com/villano-lab/galactic-spin-W1/tree/master/binder/environment.yml>`_ to run our notebooks.

0. Install `Anaconda Python <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.
1. `Download <https://github.com/villano-lab/galactic-spin-W1/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>`_ and unzip the repository somewhere inside your user directory, such as the "Documents" folder.
2. In Anaconda Navigator, go to "Environments," then select "Import."
3. Import from "Local drive" and select the file `binder/environment.yml <https://github.com/villano-lab/galactic-spin-W1/tree/master/binder/environment.yml>`_ from the repository. Name the environment `galactic-spin`. Anaconda will start installing all other necessary dependencies; please be patient, as this will take some time.
4. Once the environment is finished building, from the "Home" menu of Anaconda Navigator, launch a prompt. The prompt will depend on your system -- for example, in Windows, you can choose "CMD.exe Prompt."
5. In the prompt, run the following command: `ipython kernel install --user --name=galactic-spin`
6. In Anaconda Navigator, launch "JupyterLab" and browse to your local copy of the repository, then enter the `binder` subdirectory. Enjoy!
