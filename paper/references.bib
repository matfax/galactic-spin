We show that parameter degeneracies present in lower resolution data are lifted at these higher resolutions. 34 per cent of the galaxies do not have a meaningful fit when using the NFW profile and 32 per cent when using the pseudo-isothermal profile, however only 14 per cent do not have a meaningful fit in either model. In both models we find correlations between the disc baryon fraction fd and the spin parameter of the halo λ′, between fd and the dark halo mass M200, and between M200 and the concentration parameter c. We show that the distribution of the concentration parameter c, for a NFW halo, is in good agreement with CDM predictions; no significant galaxy population is found with very low values of c. The overall distribution of λ′ is in good agreement with theoretical predictions from hierarchical tidal torque theory. The whole sample is also well fitted by a pseudo-isothermal dark halo with a core, but the size of the core is rather small (6 per cent of the virial radius or smaller; for 70 per cent of the sample the core size is less than 2 kpc). Thus we conclude that the profile of dark matter is steep (r−1 or steeper) down to this radius; large dark matter cores (and therefore very low dark matter central densities) seem to be excluded. Low-surface-brightness galaxies tend to have higher values of λ′ for a given fd and lower values of c for a given mass than high-surface-brightness galaxies. In an appendix we give some useful formulae for pseudo-isothermal profile haloes and we discuss in detail the issue of parameter degeneracies.}",

The disc truncation leaves a ‘signature’ on the rotation curve, in the form of a region of nearly constant velocity, followed by a steep decline of velocity just outside the truncation. Such a feature is clearly present in the observed rotation curve of NGC 5907, in which the luminosity truncation is also present.The observed velocity curve of NGC 5907 can be well reproduced by a two-component model, with a smooth spherical distribution of ‘dark mass’ (a halo) superimposed on the luminous disc. The best-fitting values for the mass in the disc and in the halo (inside the optical truncation) are 9 and 13.5 × 1010 solar masses, respectively. The mass-to-light ratio (luminosity in the J band) is about 11, in solar units.The model predicts the values of some quantities, such as the thickness of the gas layer, that could possibly be observed in the near future, thus providing a clear-cut test of the model itself.}",

I show the rotation curves for a family of fiducial bulges with Sérsic surface brightness profiles and with various concentrations and intrinsic axis ratios. Both parameters have a profound impact on the shape of the rotation curve. In particular, I show how the peak rotation velocity, as well as the radius where it is reached, depends on both parameters.I also discuss the implications of the flattening of a bulge for the decomposition of a rotation curve and use the case of NGC 5533 to show the errors that result from neglecting it. For NGC 5533, neglecting the flattening of the bulge leads to an overestimate of its mass-to-light ratio by approximately 30 per cent and an underestimate of the contributions from the stellar disc and dark matter halo in the regions outside the bulge-dominated area.}",

    abstract = "{We present deep B- and R-band surface photometry for a sample of 21 early-type disc galaxies with morphological types between S0 and Sab and absolute B-band magnitudes between −17 and −22. Six galaxies were also observed in the I-band. We present radial profiles of surface brightness, colour, ellipticity, position angle and deviations of axisymmetry for all galaxies, as well as isophotal and effective radii and total magnitudes. We have decomposed the images into contributions from a spheroidal bulge with a general Sérsic profile and a flat disc with an arbitrary intensity distribution, using an interactive, 2D decomposition technique. We caution against the use of simple 1D decomposition methods and show that they can lead to systematic biases, particularly in the derived bulge parameters.We study in detail the relations between various bulge and disc parameters. In particular, we find that the bulges of our galaxies have surface brightness profiles ranging from exponential to De Vaucouleurs, with the average value of the Sérsic shape parameter n being 2.5. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the shape of the bulge intensity distribution depends on luminosity, with the more luminous bulges having more centrally peaked light profiles (i.e. higher n). By comparing the ellipticity of the isophotes in the bulges to those in the outer, disc-dominated regions, we are able to derive the intrinsic axis ratio qb of the bulges. The average axis ratio is 0.55, with a rms spread of 0.12. None of the bulges in our sample is spherical, whereas in some cases, the bulges can be as flat as qb= 0.3–0.4. The bulge flattening seems to be weakly coupled to luminosity, more luminous bulges being on average slightly more flattened than their lower luminosity counterparts. Our finding that most bulges are significantly flattened and have an intensity profile shallower than R1/4 suggests that ‘pseudo-bulges’, formed from disc material by secular processes, do not occur in late-type spiral galaxies only, but are a common feature in early-type disc galaxies as well.Most galaxies in our sample have radial colour gradients, becoming bluer towards larger radii. Although this can partly be explained by the radially declining contribution of the red bulges to the observed light, we show that discs must also have intrinsic colour gradients.}",

	journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
	abstract = {From a diameter-limited sample of 86 low-inclination (face-on) spiral galaxies, the bulge-to-disk size and luminosity ratios and other quantitative measurements for the prominence of the bulge are derived. The bulge and disk parameters have been estimated using a seeing-convolved Sérsic r1/n bulge and a seeing-convolved exponential disk that were fitted to the optical (B, R, and I) and near-infrared (K) galaxy light profiles. In general, early-type spiral galaxy bulges have Sérsic values of n > 1, and late-type spiral galaxy bulges have values of n < 1. In the B band, only eight galaxies have a bulge shape parameter n consistent with the exponential value 1, and only five galaxies do in the K band. Use of the exponential bulge model is shown to restrict the range of re/h and B/D values by more than a factor of 2. Application of the r1/n bulge models, unlike exponential bulge models, results in a larger mean re/h ratio for the early-type spiral galaxies than for the late-type spiral galaxies, although this result is shown not to be statistically significant. The mean B/D luminosity ratio is, however, significantly larger (>3 σ) for the early-type spirals than for the late-type spirals. Two new parameters are introduced to measure the prominence of the bulge. The first is the difference between the central surface brightness of the galaxy and the surface brightness level at which the bulge and disk contribute equally. The other test uses the radius at which the contribution from the disk and bulge light are equal, normalized for the effect of intrinsically different galaxy sizes. Both of these parameters reveal that the early-type spiral galaxies "appear" to have significantly (more than 2 σ in all passbands) bigger and brighter bulges than late-type spiral galaxies. This apparent contradiction with the re/h values can be explained with an iceberg-like scenario, in which the bulges in late-type spiral galaxies are relatively submerged in their disk. This can be achieved by varying the relative stellar density while maintaining the same effective bulge-to-disk ratio. The B/D luminosity ratio and the concentration index C31, in agreement with past studies, are positively correlated and decrease as one moves along the spiral Hubble sequence toward later spiral galaxy types, although for galaxies with large extended bulges the concentration index no longer traces the B/D luminosity ratio in a one-to-one fashion. A strong (Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient, rs = 0.80) and highly significant positive correlation exists between the shape, n, of the bulge light profile and the bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio. The absolute bulge magnitude–log n diagram is used as a diagnostic tool for comparative studies with dwarf elliptical and ordinary elliptical galaxies. At least in the B band these objects occupy distinctly different regions of this parameter space. While the dwarf elliptical galaxies appear to be the faint extension to the brighter elliptical galaxies, the bulges of spiral galaxies do not; for a given luminosity they have a noticeably smaller shape parameter and hence a more dramatic decline of stellar density at large radii.}

In most cases, we find the pseudoisothermal halo to better represent the data than the NFW halo, as the NFW concentrations are often lower than expected for a ΛCDM cosmology. We also compare our results to previous studies and find that including the new two-dimensional optical data does not significantly alter the halo parameters but does decrease the uncertainties by roughly a factor of 2.}

	abstract = {We present high-resolution optical velocity fields from DensePak integral field spectroscopy, along with derived rotation curves, for a sample of low surface brightness galaxies. In the limit of no baryons, we fit the NFW and pseudoisothermal halo models to the data and find the rotation curve shapes and halo central densities to be better described by the isothermal halo. For those galaxies with photometry, we present halo fits for three assumptions of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, Υ*. We find that the velocity contribution from the baryons is significant enough in the maximum disk case that maximum disk and the NFW halo are mutually exclusive. We find a substantial cusp mass excess at the centers of the galaxies, with at least 2 times more mass expected in the cuspy CDM halo than is allowed by the data. We also find that to reconcile the data with ΛCDM, ~20 km s−1 noncircular motions are needed and/or the power spectrum has a lower amplitude on the scales that we probe.}
